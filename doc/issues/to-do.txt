functional, tuple: replace return type of ApplyMethod, InvokeMethod to pair<bool, optional>

Generic-container: generic work with any container

WeakMethodInvoker: refactor + big attention to Wrappers for storing in container. They need to be refactored.





Upgrade (not critical improvements):

Weak-method-invoker  ->  method-invoker. Working with object and any type of smart pointers in object_ptr member data.
    Maybe work with generic smart pointer.
