functional, tuple: replace return type of ApplyMethod, InvokeMethod to pair<bool, optional>

Generic-container: generic work with any container

WeakMethodInvoker: refactor + big attention to Wrappers for storing in container. They need to be refactored.

Check lambdas in stadard parallel algorithms for capturing references, cause parallel algorithms mustn't use shared resources.



Upgrade (not critical improvements):

Weak-method-invoker  ->  method-invoker. Working with object and any type of smart pointers in object_ptr member data.
    Maybe work with generic smart pointer.
